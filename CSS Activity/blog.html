                <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                <p>HTML is a markup language used to create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links on web pages. Unlike programming languages that create functions and actions, HTML focuses on the organization and presentation of content.</p>
                <p>HTML is the cornerstone of web development. With its simple yet powerful structure, it forms the skeleton of every web page. By mastering HTML, you lay the groundwork for learning more complex web technologies like CSS and JavaScript. Happy coding!</p>

                <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                <p>CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It defines how elements should be rendered on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS separates content from design, allowing you to style multiple pages consistently and efficiently.</p>
                <p>CSS is more than just a tool for adding color and fonts; it's a vital technology that enables you to create beautiful, functional, and responsive websites. By mastering CSS, you open the door to endless creative possibilities in web design. Happy styling!</p>

                <h2>What is JS?</h2>

                <p>JavaScript is an indispensable tool in web development, opening doors to countless possibilities. Its versatility and widespread use make it a must-learn for anyone interested in creating interactive web experiences. Start experimenting with JavaScript, and watch your web pages come to life!</p>
